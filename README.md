# Planet System Clock

A clock represented by the orbiting of planetary bodies in a distant galaxy.

The star orbits the black hole twice a day,
the planet revolves around it's star once an hour,
the moon circles the planet every minute,
and the comet completes a revolution in a second.

Mouseover the bodies for an interface.
